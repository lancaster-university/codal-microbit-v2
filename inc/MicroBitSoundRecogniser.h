/*
 *
 * The sound recogniser takes in data from the audio processor - in
 * form of AudioFrameAnalysis. It then tries to match the history 
 * against samples of sounds. 
 *  
 *  
 * Sound fingerprint
 *  
 * A sound has multiple sequences, each sequence having multiple samples
 * to account for the randomness. 
 *  
 * Each sequence also has:
 *     a threshold -   the maximum absolute difference from the sampled 
 *                     frequency and the heard frequency.  
 *     maximum number of deviations - the maximum number of datapoints 
 *                     that can be more than the threshold away from the
 *                     sampled frequency
 *  
 * A sound also has a maximum number of deviations - the total maximum 
 * deviations across all sequences.
