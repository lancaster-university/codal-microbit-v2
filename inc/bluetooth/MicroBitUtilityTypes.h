/* Define types for the MicroBitUtilityService
 *
 * request_t  - Request sent from client to service.
 *              job   (1 byte)          - see below
 *              type  (1 byte)          - specifies the request type
 *              data  (up to 18 bytes)  - depends on request type
 *
 * reply_t    - Reply from service to client.
 *              job   (1 byte)          - see below
 *              data  (up to 19 bytes)  - depends on request type
 *
 * job        - Synchronize requests and replies.
 *              Enables the client to ignore replies to a previous request, and detect missing reply packets.
 *              Client cycles high nibble i.e. { 0x00, 0x10, 0x20, ..., 0xF0, 0x00, ...}
 *              Service reply cycles low nibble, i.e client job + { 0x00, 0x01, 0x02, ..., 0x0E, 0x00, ... }
 *              low nibble == 0x0F (jobLowERR) in a reply indicates error (data = 4 bytes signed integer error)
 *
 * Request types and data contents:
 *
 * type 1     - Log file length
 * request      format    (1 byte)          - 0 = HTML header; 1 = HTML; 2 = CSV
 * reply        length    (4 bytes)         - unsigned integer log data length
 *
 * type 2     - Log file data
 * request      format    (1 byte)          - 0 = HTML header; 1 = HTML; 2 = CSV
 *              reserved  (1 byte)          - set to zero
 *              index     (4 bytes)         - unsigned integer index into file
 *              batchlen  (4 bytes)         - unsigned size in bytes to return
 *              length    (4 bytes)         - length of whole file, from request type 1 (Log file length)
 * reply        data      (up to 19 bytes)  - 1 or more reply packets, to total batchlen bytes
