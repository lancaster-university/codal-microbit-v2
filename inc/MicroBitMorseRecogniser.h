/*
 * The sound recogniser takes in data from the audio processor - in 
 * form of AudioFrameAnalysis. It then tries to identify whether 
 * the listening frequency was played during that frame. Based on 
 * the last frames it sends dots ('.'), dashes ('-'), letter spaces 
 * (' '), word spaces (';'), and end-of-transmission ('#') to the 
 * data sink connected.
 * 
 * Algorithm
 * 
 * The recogniser first converts the AudioFrameAnalysis data in 
 * booleans which represent whether or not the listening frequency was 
 * being played in that frame. A timeUnit is calculated based on the 
 * sampling frequency and the number of samples taken before analysis 
 * by the audio processor - it represents the number of frames a dot 
 * should take.
 * 
 * It has 2 values: zeros and ones which counts for how many timeUnits 
 * the frequency wasn't being played/ was being played. The value 
 * synchronised keeps track of the last transition - true if the last 
 * transition was from the frequency not being played to it being played, 
 * false otherwise. At each transition, the values of zeros or ones are 
 * being interpreted into the right character and then reset.
 * 
 * All characters are being accumulated into a buffer and send together 
 * when the end-of-transmission character ('#') is found.
